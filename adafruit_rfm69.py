====================================================

CircuitPython RFM69 packet radio module. This supports basic RadioHead-compatible sending and
receiving of packets with RFM69 series radios (433/915Mhz).

.. warning:: This is NOT for LoRa radios!

.. note:: This is a 'best effort' at receiving data using pure Python code--there is not interrupt
    support so you might lose packets if they're sent too quickly for the board to process them.
    You will have the most luck using this in simple low bandwidth scenarios like sending and
    receiving a 60 byte packet at a time--don't try to receive many kilobytes of data at a time!

class RFM69:
    """Interface to a RFM69 series packet radio.  Allows simple sending and
    receiving of wireless data at supported frequencies of the radio
    (433/915mhz).

    :param busio.SPI spi: The SPI bus connected to the chip.  Ensure SCK, MOSI, and MISO are
        connected.
    :param ~digitalio.DigitalInOut cs: A DigitalInOut object connected to the chip's CS/chip select
        line.
    :param ~digitalio.DigitalInOut reset: A DigitalInOut object connected to the chip's RST/reset
        line.
    :param int frequency: The center frequency to configure for radio transmission and reception.
        Must be a frequency supported by your hardware (i.e. either 433 or 915mhz).
    :param bytes sync_word: A byte string up to 8 bytes long which represents the syncronization
        word used by received and transmitted packets. Read the datasheet for a full understanding
        of this value! However by default the library will set a value that matches the RadioHead
        Arduino library.
    :param int preamble_length: The number of bytes to pre-pend to a data packet as a preamble.
        This is by default 4 to match the RadioHead library.
    :param bytes encryption_key: A 16 byte long string that represents the AES encryption key to use
        when encrypting and decrypting packets.  Both the transmitter and receiver MUST have the
        same key value! By default no encryption key is set or used.
    :param bool high_power: Indicate if the chip is a high power variant that supports boosted
        transmission power.  The default is True as it supports the common RFM69HCW modules sold by
        Adafruit.

    .. note:: The D0/interrupt line is currently unused by this module and can remain unconnected.

    Remember this library makes a best effort at receiving packets with pure Python code.  Trying
    to receive packets too quickly will result in lost data so limit yourself to simple scenarios
    of sending and receiving single packets at a time.

    Also note this library tries to be compatible with raw RadioHead Arduino library communication.
    This means the library sets up the radio modulation to match RadioHead's default of GFSK
    encoding, 250kbit/s bitrate, and 250khz frequency deviation. To change this requires explicitly
    setting the radio's bitrate and encoding register bits. Read the datasheet and study the init
    function to see an example of this--advanced users only! Advanced RadioHead features like
    address/node specific packets or "reliable datagram" delivery are supported however due to the
    limitations noted, "reliable datagram" is still subject to missed packets but with it, the
    sender is notified if a packe has potentially been missed.
