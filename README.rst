CircuitPython RFM69 packet radio module.  This supports basic RadioHead-compatible sending and
receiving of packets with RFM69 series radios (433/915Mhz).

.. warning:: This is NOT for LoRa radios!

.. note:: This is a 'best effort' at receiving data using pure Python code--there is not interrupt
    support so you might lose packets if they're sent too quickly for the board to process them.
    You will have the most luck using this in simple low bandwidth scenarios like sending and
    receiving a 60 byte packet at a time--don't try to receive many kilobytes of data at a time!

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
====================

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-rfm69/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-rfm69

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-rfm69

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-rfm69


Usage Example
=============
See examples/rfm69_simpletest.py for a simple demo of the usage.
Note: the default baudrate for the SPI is 2000000 (2MHz).
The maximum setting is 10Mhz but
transmission errors have been observed expecially when using breakout boards.
For breakout boards or other configurations where the boards are separated,
it may be necessary to reduce the baudrate for reliable data transmission.
The baud rate may be specified as an keyword parameter when initializing the board.
To set it to 1000000 use :

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialze RFM radio
    rfm9x = adafruit_rfm9x.RFM9x(spi, CS, RESET, RADIO_FREQ_MHZ, baudrate=1000000)
